\value{
Data on US military bases from the Cold War period through the present. These data were initially collected by David Vine (2015). We
updated the data through 2018 for inclusion in this package. The data include two versions. The first is the country-base data, which
also includes information on the type of military facility and the longitude and latitude of the facility. The second version presents
a simple country-count data frame, where the count is the number of bases located in that country.
